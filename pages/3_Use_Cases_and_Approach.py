### 🚀 How to Use URCM

The Unified μ-Resonance Cognitive Mesh is designed for high-density semantic processing. Here is how you can leverage it:

*   **Semantic Compression:** Reduce large text corpora into stable resonance states (μ-states) without losing semantic density.
*   **Cognitive Search:** Use frequency-based vectors to find "truth" matches rather than just keyword overlaps.
*   **Low-Latency Reasoning:** Replace heavy LLM inference with O(1) attractor network lookups for common reasoning patterns.

### 🛠️ Builder's Approach

If you are a developer or system architect building on top of URCM, follow this integration pattern:

1.  **Initialize the Mesh:** Load the core `URCMSystem` with your domain-specific phoneme mappings.
2.  **Map Inputs:** Convert raw user input into frequency vectors.
3.  **Converge:** Allow the system to settle into a stable attractor state.
4.  **Extract:** Read the final `μ` score and semantic density `ρ` to determine confidence.

```python
# Example Integration Pattern
from urcm.core import URCMSystem

system = URCMSystem()
state = system.process("User query input")

if state.stability_index > 0.95:
    execute_high_confidence_action(state.payload)
else:
    fallback_to_traditional_search()
```

    ### 📈 Developer Profits (Benefits)
    
    Why switch from pure Transformer architectures?
    
    *   **Cost Efficiency:** O(1) attractor lookup replaces expensive O(N) token generation, reducing inference costs by up to 90%.
    *   **Determinism:** High $\mu$ states guarantee semantic stability, critical for regulated industries (Finance, Healthcare).
    *   **Latency:** Converging to a meaning happens in milliseconds, enabling true real-time cognitive loops.
    *   **Memory Footprint:** Semantic compression allows running complex reasoning chains on edge devices.

    ### ⚠️ Current Limitations (Cons)
    
    Trade-offs to consider before adoption:
    
    *   **Non-Generative:** URCM is a *convergence* engine, not a *generative* one. It finds the "correct" state, it doesn't write poetry.
    *   **Domain Mapping:** Requires initial calibration of phoneme-to-frequency mappings for specific jargon.
    *   **Warm-up Time:** Attractor networks need a brief initialization period to stabilize phase dynamics.
    *   **Paradigm Shift:** Requires developers to think in continuous signals rather than discrete tokens.
