Operational Foundations and Learning Theory for URCM.

This module addresses the core critiques of URCM by providing:
1. Mathematical operationalization of mu, rho, and chi.
2. A formalized learning mechanism (Resonant Hebbian Learning).
3. Information-theoretic justification for phonemic grounding.
